About the game:

You can find the damage numbers on the main.java, it also shows the mana usage and damage of each spell.

Some bosses will do some big attacks randomly, the text will appear in purple, strongly advised to defend in these cases or you will take a huge amount of damage.

If your hp reaches 0, Game Over.

Your basic spells can miss depending on your accuracy, but the spells (wingardium, accio...) never miss.

Damage potions buff the basic spells damage, not the other spells.

In the last level, Unless you cast expeliarmus when voldemort is about to cast avada kedavra, you will die instantly.

if you want to go to a specific level you can comment some specific code like //levelTroll.battle(wizard, troll); will skip the troll level.
